    <h1>Convex Hull Algorithms</h1>

    <h2>1. Jarvis March Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      The Jarvis March algorithm is a simple and intuitive method for finding
      the convex hull of a set of points. It starts with the leftmost point (or
      any other point on the hull) and wraps the remaining points in a
      counterclockwise (or clockwise) fashion, selecting the next point that
      makes the smallest possible counterclockwise (or clockwise) angle with the
      previous two points. The algorithm continues this process until it returns
      to the starting point, forming the convex hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> <code>O(nh)</code>, where
      <code>n</code> is the number of points and <code>h</code> is the number of
      points on the convex hull. In the worst case, where all points are on the
      convex hull, the time complexity becomes <code>O(n^2)</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Kirkpatrick-Seidel Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      The Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm is a more complex and efficient method
      for constructing the convex hull of a set of points. It is a
      divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the set of points
      into smaller subsets and constructs the convex hull for each subset. The
      algorithm then merges the convex hulls of the subsets to form the overall
      convex hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merging step is optimized using a technique called the
      "marriage-before-conquest" approach, which involves pre-sorting the points
      based on their x-coordinates and performing a linear scan to merge the
      hulls efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> <code>O(n log h)</code>, where
      <code>n</code> is the number of points and <code>h</code> is the number of
      points on the convex hull. This is better than the Jarvis March algorithm
      for large input sizes and when the number of points on the convex hull is
      significantly smaller than the total number of points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The choice between these algorithms depends on the specific requirements
      of the problem, such as the input size, the distribution of points, and
      the desired trade-off between simplicity and efficiency.
